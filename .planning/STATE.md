# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Cargo features select allocator at build time (no LD_PRELOAD).
- Init: Custom duration-based harness over Criterion (throughput + latency-distribution shape).
- Init: axum + serde_json + tokio chosen as the canonical web bench.
- Init: Plotly HTML dashboard (results inlined) — no Python or server dependency.
- Init: Coarse granularity → 5 MVP-shaped phases preserved from research SUMMARY.md.
